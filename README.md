### Course 2 - Programming with Javascript

#### Week 4 - Writing tests with Jest

I have been stuck on week 3 and week for the longest. I think I lost a bit of motivation due to my demands at work and limited time with my family and friends because of it. Getting back on track now. Another component to the delay is testing has always been the more difficult subject for me to understand, at least in the coding bootcamp I attended. I will add here some info that may be useful, the tools and frameworks have newer versions since the time this course was created: 

Checking to see if I have NodeJS installed on my system:

```
node --version
```
- Instructor version: 16.15
- My version: v18.8.0


Checking to see if I have NPM installed on my system:

```
npm --version
```

- Instructor version: 8.5
- My version: 9.8.1

#### Feedback on this module / section of the course:
1. It got difficult to follow along with what the instructor was saying, mainly because the closed captions weren't 100% correct and because the instructional videos were so blurry, it was near impossible to make out what I was reading. I will have to test this on other screens to be sure and will report back with updates.
