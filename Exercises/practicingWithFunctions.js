// Task 1:
// Write a function named letterFinder that accepts two parameters: word and match.

function letterFinder (word, match) {
    
}

// Task 2:
// Code a 'for' loop inside the function's body. The for loop's counter should start at zero, increment by 1 on each iteration and exit when the counter variable's value is equal to the length of the word parameter.

function letterFinder (word, match) {
    for (let i = 0; i < word.length(); i++);
}

// Task 3:
// Add an if statement inside the for loop whose condition works as follows:

// 1. Access each of the letters inside the passed in word using the counter variable, with word[i]. 

// 2. Check if the current word[i] is equal to the value of match.

function letterFinder (word, match) {
    for (let i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
        if (word[i] == match) {
            
        }
    }
}
