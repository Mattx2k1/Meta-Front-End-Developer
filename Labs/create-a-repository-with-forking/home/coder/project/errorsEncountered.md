# Lab - Create a Repository with Forking

## 12/31/23

### Error report

When trying to Fork the repository as instructed in the course, I am met with a 404 page not found error. Here is the link:

https://github.com/Meta-Front-End-Developer-PC/m3l2_forking_lab 

And a screenshot:

### Workaround

I downloaded the lab files and added them to my Meta Front-End-Developer course repo. I've forked projects before and cloned them to my device. I've also cloned from another remote repository and switched the origin to my own remote repository and pushed the cloned repo there. Not sure if that is a best practice but it has worked for me.
